## Microsoft Message Analyzer Deprecation Notice 
Microsoft Message Analyzer (MMA) will be retired and its download packages removed from microsoft.com sites on November 25 2019. 

**Versions Affected**
Versions 1.4 and earlier.

**Reason for Deprecation**
Microsoft Message Analyzer was last released in October 2016 and has not been under active development since that date. There are no plans for further public releases of Microsoft Message Analyzer. 

**Impact**
If you already have Microsoft Message Analyzer installed, you may continue to use it, along with the OPN parsers you have already downloaded. However, after November 25 2019, no versions of Microsoft Message Analyzer will be made available for public download on Microsoft.com sites and you will no longer be able to download OPN parsers. 

**Recommendations**
If you donâ€™t already have Microsoft Message Analyzer installed, install it now before November 25 2019 from <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44226>. 
If you already have Microsoft Message Analyzer installed, download the latest OPN parser packages before November 25 2019 by following the steps at <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/message-analyzer/managing-microsoft-opn-parser-packages>. 

**Replacement**
There is no Microsoft replacement product for Microsoft Message Analyzer. For similar functionality, use a 3rd party network protocol analyzer tool such as WireShark <https://wireshark.org>.
