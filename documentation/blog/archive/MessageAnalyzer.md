As interoperability relies mainly on the network interaction  
between systems and services, it is of the utmost importance to have
tools  
handy that can help analyze and understand the traffic generated as a  
consequence of such interaction.

In recent years we have seen Microsoft shaping its historic  
tool “Network Monitor” into a more advanced kit that become very useful
in the  
interoperability world.

Last September marked the release of the newest and most  
advanced tool that Microsoft has ever built to help analyze the
interaction  
between systems and services over the network. This tool is a departure
from  
Network Monitor and it brings a totally new approach in network
analysis.

Its name is Message Analyzer (or MA for short) and you can  
download it from here:

Even though we might occasionally post tips/tricks or  
details about this tool in this blog, we understand that it is
unnecessary to  
duplicate information in the already so crowded internet.

Since we have a close interaction with MA’s program manager  
and developers, we feel strongly about their blog being a great source
of  
information about this powerful tool.

Please feel free to explore the MA blog at:
